Extensive Panopto Help Resources, including editing: <https://support.panopto.com/s/>

To access this site, you will need to create an account. Just provide
your name, email address, Panopto URL (usask.cloud.panopto.eu), and
create a password. Please note that these more detailed and in-depth
instructional videos will hardly be needed on a regular basis.

## A few helpful pointers:

    -   It is good practice to record to your MyFolder first, then edit,
        and then move/copy to your class folder. Otherwise, students
        will be able to see the pre-final materials before you cut and
        edit the video.

    -   It is easier to cut a video in Panopto than to merge videos

    -   However, your recordings will be more versatile if they are
        shorter. I.e., you may want to consider breaking down your
        content into smaller modules that could be used in more than one
        class.

    -   Avoid lengthy greetings and backmatter for those smaller
        modules, as it will feel redundant to students who might be
        binge-watching 20 of them at a time.

    -   If you hit the "pause" button during recording, Panopto will
        continue to record audio, video, and other sources, but it will
        automatically "gray out" those portions as if you were manually
        cutting the video in the editor. This can be very helpful for
        postprocessing. If you feel that you want to record another take
        on a specific passage, just hit the pause button, get organized,
        and re-record after unpausing. In the editor view, it will be
        very easy to find this "grayed out" passage you want to be cut.
        You can now simply move the sliders depending on how much you
        want to be cut, and you are done.

    -   Use proper headings on your PowerPoint slides. Thes headings
        will automatically be used to "chunk" content in the Panopto
        viewer, which provides students with a helpful timeline to
        navigate your content. This can be edited manually, but it is
        much easier if headings on PowerPoint slides are formatted as
        headings.

    -   Panopto can be used to export recordings as Podcasts, i.e.,
        video files. You will need to choose which video and audio
        channels you want to combine, which is straightforward for
        lectures and demos with just one active screen and instructor
        audio and video, but more complicated for multiple video sources
        at once, i.e., if you also have a document camera, etc.
