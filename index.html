<h1> SENS Online Program Delivery Taskforce </h1>

<p>This website is a repository of guidelines and information for SENS faculty preparing their courses. This content was prepared by the SOPD (listed below) and in consultation with the broader faculty. We provide here guidelines, templates, instructional videos and links to resources to help make your course as high quality as possible. In some cases, we provide minimum necessary requirements, which must be adopted in the coures in the professional programs.</p>


<h1> IMPORTANT NOTE:</h1>

If you require urgent support during a live remote session you may call 306-966-4263 to get IT support. This is not for non-urgent (i.e. live) support - for that you should submit a ticket to the <a href="https://itsupport.usask.ca/">IT portal</a>.
