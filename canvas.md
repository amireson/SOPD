Canvas is the new LMS to replace blackboard. This is being launched on June 15, 2020. SENS is designated as an early adopter, with support from the central LMS working group to get all SENS courses into canvas by December 2020. The SOPD will be testing canvas and posting our recommendations and guidelines here.
