Canvas is more than simply a replacement for blackboard - it encourages us to consider new ways to teach our courses, particularly if those courses are online. There are loads of resources for learning Canvas, both internal and external, as well as training opportunities hosted by the Distance Education Unit and Gwenna Moss. All SENS lecturers are encouraged to put some effort into learning Canvas and putting together their course material making use of the wide range of media that are now available to us. The best way to proceed is by a combination of looking at what others have done and reproducing the methods that you like in your classes, and by reading up on the resources that have been shared with us. All faculty should have access to development courses in canvas - just log in at [canvas.usask.ca](https://canvas.usask.ca). Your dashboard will look something like this:

# Communicating with students

There are a number of ways to communicate with students through canvas, but based on 1 week experience teaching a class - I (Andrew) find the canvas inbox to be the best. This behaves exactly like email, but you can easily find individual students or groups of students to send to. This will send you email notifications if you get a message, but you cannot reply through your regular email. Also - *hot tip* use the canvas teacher app on your phone - it's easy to reply to messages through this. 

# Using a phone/tablet

Short version = don't expect students to have a nice experience if they try to use phone to watch content. I (Andrew) only recommend using phone for the inbox.

Here, we curate what the SOPD believes are the best of these resources.

# Compilation of Canvas resources

[Here](https://sites.usask.ca/edtech/rcdg/) are the detailed guidelines prepared by the DEU for preparing online courses. This is recommended reading before you start building/revising your course.

[Here](https://teaching.usask.ca/remote-teaching/index.php) is a similar guide that was put together by the Gwenna Moss center. 

Read [this](https://words.usask.ca/gmcte/2020/05/25/offering-seminar-courses-remotely/) if you are thinking about including seminars in your course.

The distance education unit (DEU) releases weekly "digests", all of which are available here: [https://sites.usask.ca/edtech/deu-digest-archive/](https://sites.usask.ca/edtech/deu-digest-archive/)
