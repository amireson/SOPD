title: More canvas advice

Here is advice for teaching compressed, online courses, written by Andrew after teaching ENVS806.

You can look at my course on canvas, [here](https://canvas.usask.ca/courses/1871). My course involved 13 modules, all with recorded video content. I ran six synchronous sessions, all of which were recorded live on webex, videos were uploaded to panopto, and I had a module for this, [here](https://canvas.usask.ca/courses/1871/pages/meeting-4th-september-2020?module_item_id=89382).

I think the single most important thing to get right in the professional programs, is the facilitation of effective cohort building and discussion. With ~20 students in a class, it's not that easy to get them to contribute to live discussion, unless you do so in a planned and structured way. If I were to do 806 again, I would **include more subgroup discussions**, and I'd figure out how to have breakouts in webex (not even sure this is possible), or use zoom.

In my class, I assigned students into pairs for one assignment where they co-recorded prewsentations, and into groups of 3-4 for another assignment, where they just had to discuss their findings. This was all successful, and I should have done more. 

All meetings I held used webex, and I simply opened my personal room to the students, and sent out an announcement 30 minutes before the start. I added the timing for all sessions in the canvas calendar, so there were no surprises. I had zero problems with confusion over dates/times and I had zero webex problems!!! 

I used the "inbox" in canvas to communicate with students. This works well - it's exactly like email. It is important to be responsive to student queries for the duration of your course. One student told me that online delivery is challenging because you can't get that instant feedback or ask a clarifying question during the lecture. This is unavoidable with asynchronous content. I got lots of email questions. I also added an open discussion page to each module - these had a moderate uptake.

It is essential to "closed-caption" your panopto vidoes - there are guidelines on how to do that [here]({{site.baseurl}}/panopto)

Some professional students are working part-time, and as such they have various commitments - during my class some were out for a day or two doing field work. Therefore, I recommend being as flexible as you can with deadlines. 

Recall that your course is split into modules (equivalent to lectures) and modules are in turn split into pages, assignments and discussions (I only used those three), each of which is an individual webpage. Pages are just for content (text, linked files, embedded videos). Discussions can have the same content, but at the bottom the students can (or must if you want to require it) make some comment.

The sequencing of the course is controlled at the module level. Next to the module, click the three dots and go to edit:

When you edit a module you can add "pre-requisites" and "requirements" - use this. In module "requirements" you likely want to choose the option that the students must work through pages in sequence. This stops them from jumping ahead. In this manner, I think deadlines are less important. You will likely want to use the settings shown here:

Finally **in Canvas, don't forget to click publish.**
