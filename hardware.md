It is important that online lectures are recorded with high quality audio and video. Showing the instructors face while they talk provides a better student experience. [Here](https://usask.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=db55eafb-3469-4012-a5dc-abd8010c0abf) is a video explanation of how to set up a home recording studio, and [here]({{site.baseurl}}/files/infog_hardware.pdf) are the slides. We recommend a minimum necessary setup, which will include a good microphone and lighting.
