It is important that online lectures are recorded with high quality audio and video. Showing the instructors face while they talk provides a better student experience. We have prepared a set of [guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/files/infog_hardware.pdf) for setting up a home recording studio. We will recommend a minimum necessary setup, which will include a good microphone and lighting.
