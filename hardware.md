It is important that online lectures are recorded with high quality audio and video. Showing the instructors face while they talk provides a better student experience. [Here](https://usask.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=db55eafb-3469-4012-a5dc-abd8010c0abf) is a video explanation of how to set up a home recording studio, and [here]({{site.baseurl}}/files/infog_hardware.pdf) are the slides. We recommend a minimum necessary setup, which will include a good microphone and lighting.

I have the following hardware:

* Yeti Blue microphone.

* Logi webcam that I got from IT supplies before COVID19 (I think it was $100). The video quality is much better than my built in webcam, and I didn't find a good solution for using a smartphone for this.

* Ring light that Jennifer bought me. I have the light set back and above me, with a straight line between me, the webcam and the light to avoid shadows.

* iPad and apple pencil is for screen recordings of me writing equations and sketching diagrams. Works very well - basically it's a virtual whiteboard. I use quicktime (free with Mac) to record the screen of the iPad.

* Laptop screen is at eye level and close to webcam so I'm not turning my head all the time.
