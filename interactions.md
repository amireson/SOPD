Remote teaching is by a combination of **asynchronous** (i.e. not real-time, face to face) and **synchronous** delivery and student interaction. Here we provide some guidelines for each of these.


# Asynchronous

**If you are looking for tools to help recording either for teacher or students here are some ideas:**

## Screen Cast O Matic

* Can Record Screen, Webcam, or both. Max time is 15 minutes with free version.

* Can record talking about Powerpoint slides with webcam or without

## Moovly

* User friendly video making software as easy as drag and drop

* Can create fun videos using in-built templates or creating new ones

* Can create or add objects/texts to a video shot on phone to switch things up

**Are you looking for alternative ways or spaces to engage discussion in your class?**

## Yellowdig

* Interesting way to engage students in a discussion without layout (social media kind) different from traditional discussion board

* Students will earn points for interaction which can be incorporated into grading for participation

* Can be integrated with LMS

**If you want to explore other options outside Canvas for assignments interaction here are two ways:**

## Flipgrid

* Like a virtual classroom

* Teacher creates a Grid and then shares with students.

* It is a video conversation app. You create a prompt (up to 3-minute video). Can also attach PDFs or other media as prompts.

* Students can create a 90 second video response. They can respond to other’s videos with emojis.

* Can only create 1 grid with a free account but can have multiple topics.

## Voice thread

* Can create, and comment, or watch a voice thread.

* Can upload media and comment on it.

* Can comment on a voice thread/listen to others

# Synchronous

## WHY SYNCHRONOUS SESSIONS AND WHAT MIGHT THEY LOOK LIKE?

Synchronous activity is rarely the primary driver for students to select an online program. But data show the value that students attach to being able to connect with peers and their professor, and to discuss ideas and concepts in real time.

Synchronous sessions come in a variety of forms:

* Formal required meetings (live virtual classes)

* Milestone meetings (support progression, typically scheduled at start, midpoint, end of course)

* Special-focus meeting (might be designed around team collaboration and brainstorming)

* Ad hoc meetings (in response to students' questions/needs)

* Virtual office hours

* Student collaboration (creating opportunities for students to connect and collaborate in real time outside of scheduled classes) (Groups can organize a time to video chat and discuss course material using a conferencing app, or set up an ongoing conversation through an app like WhatsApp.

* Assessment (Instead of having to post on a forum or hand in an essay, students could deliver a webinar to a small group of students (or the whole class depending on the size).

**RECOMMENDATION 1** To incorporate some level of synchronous instruction into course design. Even if you opt for a largely asynchronous format, we strongly recommend that you consider Milestone meetings and/or virtual office hours as a way to make connections with your students and build in-class community. It will be important to our students to have some dedicated time available to discuss course-related issues.

*SYNCHRONOUS SESSIONS ARE CHALLENGING: PLAN, PREPARE, AND PRACTISE*

Virtual, or synchronous, class sessions can be challenging: they combine technology, interaction and instruction and introduce unknowns because they are "live". Requires planning and practise to do well.

**RECOMMENDATION 2** Be crystal clear why you need synchronous interactions with your online students. Synchronous teaching should not be another way to deliver a lecture – it should be used to accomplish things that can’t be accomplished asynchronously;  to offer novel content, insights, or activities and avoid duplicating what is covered elsewhere in the course. Always have a clear objective for your synchronous sessions, and be able to communicate to students why such activities require in-person, real-time participation.

**RECOMMENDATION 3** Know your class and your students (background, class size, geographic spread, internet connectivity) before deciding: (i) the extent to which synchronous sessions can be built into course design; and, (ii) an appropriate balance of formal and ad hoc uses of synchronous time. If you're concerned about the logistical and technological demands of holding large numbers of synchronous sessions, see RECOMMENDATION 1.

**RECOMMENDATION 4** Get to know your web conferencing tool /platform (i.e. WebEx, integrated video on Canvas) and key features:

* options to share files and links

* chat features

* options to group students and structure in-class group exercises / discussions (breakout sessions in WebEx virtual classroom)

* Whiteboards and Desktop sharing to annotate content and create interactive audio-visual experience.

Learn how these features work, separately and/or in tandem, to enhance participation and communication. In class, navigating between tools can create “dead time” - decreasing student engagement and distracts from what you are trying to accomplish. The better you get at using your chosen web conferencing tool /platform and key features, the less a problem “dead time” will be.

**RECOMMENDATION 5** Practice what you’ve learnt in mock classes before your course begins

**RECOMMENDATION 6** Wherever possible, record your synchronous sessions to make them a resource and part of a course archive for your students and yourself to look back on. This can be extremely important when synchronous sessions/meetings do not fit a student's schedule and they can’t attend.

**RECOMMENDATION 7** Accept that technology will fail.  Screens will freeze.  Users will drop unexpectedly.  Some elements are outside your control.  A back-up dial-in number, alternate meeting platform, or even re-scheduling for another day/time are options you want in your back pocket for when technology is not cooperating. As per RECOMMENDATION 6, ensure that sessions are recorded for those who aren’t present.

**RECOMMENDATION 8** Follow-up on your synchronous sessions. Ask students what they thought about the session. Feedback helps you adjust for future sessions so that they feel like "collective" class meetings instead of simply professor presentations (which could have been done asynchronously). REMEMBER to circulate recordings, images, and presentations to keep instruction and reflection going after the session ends.

**RECOMMENDATION 9** Don’t forget to use synchronous session to build your virtual community and sense of belonging. Beyond course content, synchronous sessions provide a golden opportunity to connect on a more personal level. At the beginning of class, do a quick social check-in. Check everyone is okay. Make students feel comfortable to participate but also to reach out to you when they need to.

*DO BACKGROUND RESEARCH*

**RECOMMENDATION 10** Put the effort in to better understand the do’s and don’ts of synchronous online teaching and learning, and if and how it makes sense to incorporate synchronous sessions as part of your courses and in light of your teaching style/philosophy. There is a ton of material in printed and online formats to give you some ideas. Below are just a few of the resources to access:

* The more detailed 6-pager on ‘Tips-tools-technologies for Synchronous Sessions’) that the SOPD Taskforce prepared.

* Dig Deeper: Humanizing Online Teaching and Learning (link here: Read Humanizing Online Teaching and Learning) This book offers critical thinking about how to humanize your online course experiences and maintain a social presence as the course instructor. Helpful information on communicating effectively, using video and audio, social learning in online environments and much more to help you make your course a more human experience and build your online learning community.
