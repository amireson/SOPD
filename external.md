Some recommendations sent in by Christy:

I think the most important thing is to have learning modules built with similar consistent and easy to follow structures. DEU recommend the following as front material for each module which seems more important than what the slides look like:

* Overview (what will I learn this week?)
* Learning Objectives (what will I be expected to do by the end?)
* Module Instructions (how should I proceed through the materials provided?)
* Required Readings (what additional readings are required this week?)
* Key Terms and Concepts (what should I be keeping an eye out for in the module?)

[Here](https://words.usask.ca/gmcte/2020/05/21/modules/) is a link that introduces this concept

and [here](https://sites.usask.ca/edtech/rcdg/development-process/) the most recent DEU release goes into more depth on this
