## A note on Copyright

A friendly reminder that the use of images in presentations may be subject to copyright. Here’s a [quick](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/h_wr02281.html) guide to Canadian copyright laws.

Most pertinent to academic faculty, staff and students is the principle of [Fair Dealing](https://fair-dealing.ca/what-is-fair-dealing/). The [Canadian Copyright Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/) allows the use of material from a copyright protected work (literature, musical scores, audiovisual works, etc.) without permission when certain conditions are met. People can use fair dealing for research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review, and news reporting. In order to ensure your copying is fair, you need to consider several factors such as the amount you are copying, whether you are distributing the copy to others, and whether your copying might have a detrimental effect on potential sales of the original work.

Consider the tenets of plagiarism: don’t pass off work as your own, cite your sources, and if you’re using more than a small piece of someone else’s content consider whether you should be paying for the right to use that material.


## Design Tools
